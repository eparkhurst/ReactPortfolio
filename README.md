# New Portfolio Site using React

I was recently turned down for a job because my portfolio site didn't look the same in safari.
Well Fuck those guys my site looks great now. I went for a material design and kept it simple.
I used React and wrote all the CSS from scratch. And yes, it looks exactly the same in Firefox
and Safari as it does in chrome.
